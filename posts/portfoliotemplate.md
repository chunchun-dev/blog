## Introduction

I made a small personal portfolio template for others to use as their own portfolio, with easy configuration and instructions on how to use. In making this site I tried my best to make it as developer friendly as possible, adding descriptive type declarations in my Typescript and comments to help guide developers who are new to React to just know the bare minimum to get started using the template.

## Tech stack

In this project, I used Next JS, which I'm already familiar with, with Typescript, a technology I had always liked but never had enough confidence in to use in a project. This project was mainly to practice using Typescript in a React codebase to get my feet wet.
